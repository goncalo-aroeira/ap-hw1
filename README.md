# Deep Learning Homework 1 - IST 2023/24

This repository contains the solutions for Homework 1 of the Deep Learning course at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (IST). The assignment covers three topics: medical image classification using linear models and neural networks, implementation with an autodiff framework, and Boolean function computation with MLPs.

## Topics Covered
### 1. Medical Image Classification  
- Implementation of **Perceptron, Logistic Regression, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** for medical image classification on the **OCTMNIST dataset**.  
- Comparison of **different learning rates** and training methods.  
- Training with **stochastic gradient descent** without using machine learning libraries.  
- Evaluation using accuracy metrics and visualization of training loss curves.  

### 2. Automatic Differentiation and Deep Learning Frameworks  
- Implementation of **logistic regression and neural networks using PyTorch**.  
- Comparison of training with different **batch sizes, learning rates, and dropout regularization**.  
- Performance analysis and hyperparameter tuning.  

### 3. Boolean Function Computation with MLPs  
- Implementation of a **multi-layer perceptron** to compute Boolean functions.  
- Analysis of **single-layer perceptrons vs. multi-layer perceptrons** in solving non-linearly separable problems.  
- Experiments with **hard-threshold activations and ReLU activations**.  

## Installation & Setup
